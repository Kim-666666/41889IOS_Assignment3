### Assessment Task 3

Group project: Design and develop an application
Due date: 22 May 2022, 11:59 pm
This project is worth 30% of the overall mark for this subject.

### Introduction

You will create an application that solves a real-world problem for a fictional user persona. You will follow an iterative product design cycle to produce a minimum viable product. On the final day of class you will demonstrate the product to fictional investors in a presentation.

### Requirements

1. You shall work in a group of three or four members.

2. Students shall create a source code repository using Github. The final group project (zip file) is required to submit in Canvas. The link for github repository should also be provided in a README.md file in the project zip file. Student groups will describe their product in a final presentation.

3. You shall follow the Product Design cycle, iteratively planning, prototyping, and testing more detailed versions of your app.

4. You shall demonstrate your application in a 5-minues presentation, showing the developed app, and answering questions listed in marking criteria.

### Assessment

15 marks: assessment of your groupwork and review of your code design 15 marks: Final presentation

### Late submission

Because of the group nature of this project and the semester teaching schedule, no extensions or special consideration will be considered. The due date is final.

### Suggested Topics

Each group is encouraged to come up with their own app idea. If your group is unable to decide what to develop, select a topic from the suggestions below.

1. Design and implement a crypto-currency wallet application that can hold a minimum of three currencies. The application doesn't require the implementation of a backend-server to manage wallets. The design should be visually appealing. (For example: Huobi Wallet) Create an application that makes it easy for a user to view and manage their crypto- currencies. Data should be presented to the user in a meaningful and appealing way. Information such as today's loss and gain should be implemented. Inspiration can be drawn from the default iOS stock app or other crypto apps such as Blockfolio.

2. Design an online booking system for restaurants or cinemas. The app should allow the customers to select seats and cancel the booking.
