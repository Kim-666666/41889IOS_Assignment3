var describe = "J'Go L'arome brings the latest Parisian trend, Bistronomie, to Sydney, with its Michelin quality and the relaxation of a corner bistro. The large, open kitchen is a popular feature, bringing the chef closer to the guests and making the preparation process more enjoyable and relaxing. With a few strokes of the brush, you can sense the French freedom and romantic elegance with just a glance. A graduate of the Paul Bocuse Institute, Lyon, France's top western culinary and hospitality school, Fang Fang's chef has worked in several Michelin-starred restaurants in France, and is particularly adept at presenting the art of French cuisine in a simple, natural yet refined way."
